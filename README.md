# Sarah's Portfolio
Dark-themed portfolio built on React, NextJS using some React Boostrap components and CSS Animations. 
Project is dockerized and then deployed on Vercel. 

## Cloning & Navigation
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Serve localhost with `npm start`.
   
- Codebase resides main in the src folder where `src/components` stores the React components. 
- Styling is defined within one application-wide CSS file.

## Future Implementation
Some features that could be improved given more time would be the following:

1. Refine project section to have the full list and more cohesive UI.
3. Better mobile responsiveness.
