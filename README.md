# Sarah's Portfolio
Dark-themed portfolio built on React, NextJS using some React Boostrap components and CSS Animations. 
Project is dockerized and then deployed on Vercel. 

## Cloning & Navigation
1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Serve localhost with `npm start`.
   
- Codebase resides main in the src folder where `src/components` stores the React components. 
- Styling is defined within one application-wide CSS file.

## Future Implementation
Some features that could be improved given more time would be the following:

1. More robust project section since UI does not seem super cohesive with the rest of the webpage.
2. Better mobile responsiveness down to different phone sizes.
